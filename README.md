Hi, I’m @Keira-MacDonald :)
I’m a current student at University of Western Ontario pursuing computer science.
I'm looking for opportunities in summer internships, and collaborating on software projects.
If you would like to reach me, my email is Keira.Sian.MacDonald@gmail.com.
Fun fact, I'm also pursuing astrophysics on top of computer science, and I am the bass clarinetist of the Western Wind Ensemble. :)
